        <p class="answers"><br>Step 1: Make sure your printer is set-up and connected to the wireless network. If the
            printer is not set-up,
            don’t worry. Find the set-up directions that came with the printer and follow them. Usually this requires
            inserting a disc into your laptop, which makes the process much easier.</br>

            <br>Step 2: If your printer is not wireless, connect to the printer via USB cable. Most modern printers are
            wireless, but if yours does not have wireless capability, simply plug in the USB cord from the printer to
            your laptop. There is no advantage to wireless printing, except that it is more convenience. However, both
            wireless and USB printing offer the same options to the user.</br>

            <br>Step 3: Open the document(s) you want to print.</br>

            <br>Step 4: Click on FILE > PRINT or press the keys COMMAND + P (on Windows it will be CTRL + P):</br>

            <br>Step 5: Adjust settings as needed and click PRINT. Every print menu has a number of options to choose
            from,
            from the number of copies to the size of the paper you are printing on. When you’re ready to print, just
            click PRINT and your documents will begin printing after a few moments.</br>
