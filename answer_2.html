        <h1 class="pageTitle">How can you scan a document and send it to your laptop at HZ?</h1>

        <p class="answers"> <br>1. Turn on the scanner.</br>

            <br>2. Locate the software for the scanner on your computer. If you don't have the software that came with
            the scanner, most versions of Windows have a Windows Fax and Scan program installed, which works with most
            scanners.</br>

            <br>3. Count the number of pages you want to scan. If you are working with only one side of the page, we
            recommend using the flatbed, shown in the first picture below. If you are using either multiple pages or one
            page needing both sides scanned, you need a scanner with a feeder port, shown in the second picture
            below.</br>

            <br>4. When using the Windows Fax and Scan software, you need to verify at the bottom left of the computer
            screen that Scanner is selected, not Fax.</br>

            <br>5. Put the page(s) that needs to be scanned on the flatbed or in the feeder. Most scanners have
            directions on how to insert the paper, either face up or face down. Especially when using the feeder, make
            sure the paper is seated correctly so it is grabbed correctly.</br>

            <br>6. In the scanner software, click the New Scan or similar option.</br>

            <br>7. In the New Scan window, you'll need to change any settings that might apply from the available
            options. For example, options may include Profile, Source, Paper size (if not letter size), Color format,
            File type, Resolution (DPI), Brightness, and Contrast. Change each of these depending on the type of
            document you are scanning.</br>

            <br>8. Once those options are changed, click Scan.</br>

            <br>Saving the document</br>

            <br>1. After all the pages are scanned, a screen pops up showing the scanned pages. Make sure all pages are
            showing on the screen. If not, you need to re-scan the document.</br>

            <br>2. If using the Windows Fax and Scan program, at the top middle of the screen, click Save as, or you can
            click File, then click Save as.</br>

            <br>3. In the pop-up window, choose the Save in location, then type in the desired file name. Then, change
            the Save as type to .jpg, .bmp, .gif, .tiff, or .png, depending on your preference. We recommend saving any
            photos as .jpg, and any documents as .tiff. Saving documents as a .tiff reduces their size, making it easier
            to send by e-mail and similar programs.</br>

            <br>4. Once you've made the selections, click Save.</br>
